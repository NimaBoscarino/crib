Crib Rules

INIT:  Players choose 1 random card each, lowest number is starting player!

1. Deal 6 cards to each player (alternating), starting with player 1
2. Both players choose 2 cards to put into crib (owned by player 1)
3. Surprise card is revealed!
4. Each player takes turns putting down cards, getting points for doubles, series, 15, 31, "go!", and last card.
5. Pick cards up again, players count points! Start with player 1, then do player 2.
   1. Remember that the point counting includes surprise card.
6. Then player 1 picks up crib, and does points count with that hand + surprise card
7. Player 1 and 2 switch! Back to step 1
